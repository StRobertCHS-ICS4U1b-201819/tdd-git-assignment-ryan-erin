## 1) Objective

Using Test-Driven Development, you will work with a partner to create a single python module called **statTools.py** that contains functions for [Measures of Central Tendency](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/edu/power-pouvoir/ch11/5214867-eng.htm) and [Measures of Spread](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/edu/power-pouvoir/ch12/5214876-eng.htm).  

The functions you are responsible for implementing are:  

**Central Tendency**

* mean
* median
* mode

**Spread**

* range
* lower quartile
* upper quartile
* variance
* standard deviation


All functions take a list of integers as a parameter.  This list represents the data for which you are computing the specific measurement.  All functions return a single value.

### Limitations
* only standard arithmetic and the math library are to be used for computation
* list functions are permitted.
* you are not permitted to use any python statistics packages i.e numpy, scipy


## 2) Testing Details
* All tests are to be written in a file called **test_statTools.py**
* Be sure to follow the *red-green-refactor* process and write a test before implementing any code.
* Be sure to consider black-box and white-box test cases for your functions.

## 3) Git/Github Branches and Commits
* Refer to the set up instructions for assignment to create the proper git environment for your project.
* Each partner should develop in their own branch
* Only completed functions should be merged back into the master branch (stable code)
* Commits must be logged after the passing of each test.
* All code must be pushed to the your repository in Github
